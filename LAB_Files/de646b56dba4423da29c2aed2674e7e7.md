# SYSADM1 -- Data Loss

Instruction/s:

Read and analyze the data loss scenarios provided. Create a data
recovery plan by providing impact assessment, recovery plan and
preventive measures for each scenario. Lastly, answer the reflection
question.

**Evaluation Criteria Guide:**

1.  Impact Assessment:

-   Accurately identifies the potential consequences of the data loss.

-   Quantifies the potential financial, operational, and reputational
    impact.

    1.  Recovery Plan:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Proposes a detailed, feasible, and timely recovery plan.

-   Includes steps for data restoration, system recovery, and business
    continuity.

-   Identifies the necessary resources and personnel.

    1.  Preventive Measures:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Recommends specific measures to prevent similar incidents in the
    future.

-   Addresses potential vulnerabilities in security, hardware, and
    software.

-   Proposes regular backups, security audits, and employee training.

-   Recommends appropriate RAID levels for data redundancy and
    performance.
